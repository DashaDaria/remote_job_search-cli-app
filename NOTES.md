Program Architecture
1. CLI controller - deals with user input/output
2. A Job class - provides an instance of a job with:
  a. job title - company name - job type (freelancer/contractor/ft) - post date
    1. job.title, job.company_name, job.type, job.post_date

2. Scraper class - provides information to initiate into the Job class
  a. provides information that is ONLY 1 week old

? Who is responsible for outputting job information that is only 1 week old?
    - Should the scraper class only pull info 1 week old or should the job class have a method that filters the job instances by date?
